### Classification-Neural-Network
The csv data is preprocessed completely using some of the some of the techhniques like Balancing, Scaling and shuffling the whole data set.\
I've split the data into train, validation and test in the ration 0.8:0.1:0.1 \
These split data set are then converted and saved into tensor flow friendly extensions .\
and we create a Machine Learning Algorithm
