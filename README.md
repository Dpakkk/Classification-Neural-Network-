### Classification-Neural-Network
The csv data is preprocessed completely using some of the some of the techhniques like Balancing, Scaling and shuffling the whole data set.\
I've split the data into train, validation and test in the ration 0.8:0.1:0.1 \
These split data set are then converted and saved into tensor flow friendly extensions .i.e ".npz" extension .\
and we create a Machine Learning Algorithm

* Figure Description
The above figure is the network of our model. There are 10 inputs and only 2 outputs. \
Input data is taken from csv file and for two output; one is for target 1(one) and second is for target 0(zero). In the dataset 1 and 0 are the two types of tems for the classification.
